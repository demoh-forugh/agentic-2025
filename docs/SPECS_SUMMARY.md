## ðŸŽ¯ Key Takeaways

### For Workshop Attendees

1. **GPU is NOT required**
   - Workshop fully supports CPU-only operation
   - GPU expected to provide speedup but is completely optional
   - All workflows function identically with or without GPU

2. **8GB RAM target**
   - Use llama3.2:1b (1GB model) recommended
   - Performance: [TO BE MEASURED]
   - Close unnecessary applications during workshop

3. **16GB RAM target**
   - Use llama3.2 (4GB model)
   - Performance: [TO BE MEASURED]
   - Should allow multitasking during workshop

4. **32GB+ RAM target**
   - Any model size up to 7GB
   - Performance: [TO BE MEASURED]
   - Should allow multiple models simultaneously
