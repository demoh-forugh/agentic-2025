## üîç Why the High-End Demo System?

Our demo system is intentionally over-spec'd to:

1. **Test both modes**: Verify CPU-only and GPU acceleration
2. **Run multiple models**: Compare different models simultaneously
3. **Handle large audiences**: Screen sharing during presentations
4. **Stress testing**: Ensure stability under heavy load
5. **Future-proofing**: Test with larger models (13B, 70B)

**But remember**: The workshop is designed for attendees with modest hardware!
