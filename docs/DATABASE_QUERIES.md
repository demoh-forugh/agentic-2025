# PostgreSQL Query Examples for n8n

This guide provides ready-to-use SQL queries for the PostgreSQL nodes in your n8n workflows.

---

## üîå Connection Setup

Before using these queries, ensure you have configured the PostgreSQL credential in n8n:

- **Host**: `postgres` (inside Docker) or `localhost` (outside Docker)
- **Port**: `5432`
- **Database**: `workshop_db`
- **User**: `workshop`
- **Password**: `workshop_password` (from your `.env` file)

## üìä Customer Service Queries

### Fetch All Open Tickets

```sql
SELECT 
    id,
    customer_email,
    subject,
    message,
    priority,
    status,
    category,
    sentiment_score,
    created_at,
    updated_at
FROM customer_tickets
WHERE status = 'open'
ORDER BY 
    CASE priority
        WHEN 'high' THEN 1
        WHEN 'medium' THEN 2
        WHEN 'low' THEN 3
    END,
    created_at ASC;
```

**Use Case**: Get all open tickets sorted by priority and age for processing.

---

### Fetch High Priority Tickets Only

```sql
SELECT 
    id,
    customer_email,
    subject,
    message,
    priority,
    category,
    created_at
FROM customer_tickets
WHERE status = 'open'
  AND priority = 'high'
ORDER BY created_at ASC;
```

**Use Case**: Focus on urgent tickets first.

---

### Get Tickets by Category

```sql
SELECT 
    id,
    customer_email,
    subject,
    message,
    priority,
    created_at
FROM customer_tickets
WHERE category = 'technical_support'
  AND status = 'open'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

**Use Case**: Route tickets to specialized teams.

**Available Categories**:
- `technical_support`
- `billing`
- `feature_request`

    category = '{{ $json.category }}',
    priority = '{{ $json.priority }}',
    updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
WHERE id = {{ $json.ticket_id }}
RETURNING *;
```

**Use Case**: Update ticket after AI analysis in previous node.

**Note**: Use `{{ $json.field_name }}` to reference data from previous n8n nodes.

---

### Insert AI-Generated Response

```sql
INSERT INTO customer_responses (
    ticket_id,
    response_text,
    response_type
) VALUES (
    {{ $json.ticket_id }},
    '{{ $json.response_text }}',
    'ai_generated'
)
RETURNING id, ticket_id, created_at;
```

**Use Case**: Save AI-generated response for review before sending.

---

### Get Ticket with All Responses

```sql
SELECT 
    t.id,
    t.customer_email,
    t.subject,
    t.message,

    t.status,
    t.category,
    t.sentiment_score,
    t.created_at,
    json_agg(
        json_build_object(
            'response_id', r.id,
            'response_text', r.response_text,
            'response_type', r.response_type,
            'created_at', r.created_at
        ) ORDER BY r.created_at DESC
    ) AS responses
FROM customer_tickets t
LEFT JOIN customer_responses r ON t.id = r.ticket_id
WHERE t.id = {{ $json.ticket_id }}
GROUP BY t.id;
```

**Use Case**: Get complete ticket history with all responses.

---

### Close Ticket

```sql
UPDATE customer_tickets
SET 
    status = 'closed',
    updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
WHERE id = {{ $json.ticket_id }}
RETURNING *;
```

**Use Case**: Mark ticket as resolved.

---

### Get Ticket Statistics

```sql
SELECT 
    status,
    priority,
    COUNT(*) as ticket_count,
    AVG(sentiment_score) as avg_sentiment,
    MIN(created_at) as oldest_ticket,

---

## üîç Advanced Query Patterns

### Parameterized Query with Multiple Conditions

```sql
SELECT *
FROM customer_tickets
WHERE 1=1
  AND ($1::text IS NULL OR status = $1)
  AND ($2::text IS NULL OR priority = $2)
  AND ($3::text IS NULL OR category = $3)
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

**Parameters in n8n**:
- `$1`: `{{ $json.status || null }}`
- `$2`: `{{ $json.priority || null }}`
- `$3`: `{{ $json.category || null }}`

**Use Case**: Flexible filtering based on available parameters.

---

### Bulk Insert with UNNEST

```sql
INSERT INTO customer_tickets (
    customer_email,
    subject,
    message,
    priority,
    category
)
SELECT * FROM UNNEST(
    ARRAY[{{ $json.tickets.map(t => `'${t.email}'`).join(',') }}]::text[],
    ARRAY[{{ $json.tickets.map(t => `'${t.subject}'`).join(',') }}]::text[],
    ARRAY[{{ $json.tickets.map(t => `'${t.message}'`).join(',') }}]::text[],
    ARRAY[{{ $json.tickets.map(t => `'${t.priority}'`).join(',') }}]::text[],
    ARRAY[{{ $json.tickets.map(t => `'${t.category}'`).join(',') }}]::text[]
)
RETURNING *;
```

**Use Case**: Insert multiple tickets in one query.

---

### Conditional Update (Upsert)

```sql
INSERT INTO customer_tickets (
    customer_email,
    subject,
    message,
    priority,
    status
) VALUES (
    '{{ $json.email }}',
    '{{ $json.subject }}',
    '{{ $json.message }}',
    '{{ $json.priority }}',
    'open'
)
ON CONFLICT (customer_email, subject)
DO UPDATE SET
    message = EXCLUDED.message,
    priority = EXCLUDED.priority,
    updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
RETURNING *;
```

**Note**: Requires unique constraint on `(customer_email, subject)`.

**Use Case**: Update existing ticket or create new one.

---

### Date Range Query

```sql
SELECT 
    DATE(created_at) as date,
    COUNT(*) as tickets_created,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'closed' THEN 1 END) as tickets_closed,
    AVG(sentiment_score) as avg_sentiment
FROM customer_tickets
WHERE created_at >= '{{ $json.start_date }}'
  AND created_at < '{{ $json.end_date }}'
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;
```

**Use Case**: Time-based ticket metrics.

---

### Join Query for Complex Analysis

```sql
SELECT 
    t.id,
    t.customer_email,
    t.subject,
    t.priority,
    t.status,
    t.created_at,
    COUNT(r.id) as response_count,
    MAX(r.created_at) as last_response_at,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(r.created_at) - t.created_at))/3600 as hours_to_respond
FROM customer_tickets t
LEFT JOIN customer_responses r ON t.id = r.ticket_id
WHERE t.created_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY t.id
HAVING COUNT(r.id) > 0
ORDER BY hours_to_respond ASC;
```

**Use Case**: Calculate response time metrics.

## üõ†Ô∏è Utility Queries

### Check Table Row Counts

```sql
SELECT 
    'customer_tickets' as table_name,
    COUNT(*) as row_count
FROM customer_tickets
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    'customer_responses' as table_name,
    COUNT(*) as row_count
FROM customer_responses
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    'sales_data' as table_name,
    COUNT(*) as row_count
FROM sales_data
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    'processed_reports' as table_name,
    COUNT(*) as row_count
FROM processed_reports;
```

**Use Case**: Database health check and monitoring.

---

### List All Tables

```sql
SELECT 
    table_name,
    table_type
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
ORDER BY table_name;
```

**Use Case**: Discover available tables.

---

### Get Table Schema

```sql
SELECT 
    column_name,
    data_type,
    character_maximum_length,
    is_nullable,
    column_default
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'customer_tickets'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;
```

**Use Case**: Understand table structure.

---

### Test Database Connection

```sql
SELECT 
    current_database() as database,
    current_user as user,
    version() as postgres_version,
    NOW() as current_time;
```

**Use Case**: Verify connection and database info.

---

## üí° Best Practices

### 1. **Use Parameterized Queries**

‚úÖ **Good**:
```sql
WHERE id = {{ $json.ticket_id }}
```

‚ùå **Avoid**:
```sql
WHERE id = '{{ $json.ticket_id }}'  -- Can cause SQL injection
```

---

### 2. **Escape String Values**

When inserting user-provided text, escape single quotes:

```sql
'{{ $json.message.replace(/'/g, "''") }}'
```

Or use n8n's built-in SQL escaping in the PostgreSQL node settings.

---

### 3. **Use RETURNING Clause**

Always use `RETURNING *` or `RETURNING id` to get the inserted/updated data:

```sql
INSERT INTO customer_tickets (...) VALUES (...)
RETURNING *;
```

This allows you to use the result in subsequent nodes.

---

### 4. **Add Error Handling**

In your n8n workflow:
- Add an "Error Trigger" node to catch SQL errors
- Use "IF" node to check for empty results
- Log errors to a monitoring system

---

### 5. **Index Your Queries**

The `init-db.sql` already includes indexes for:
- `customer_tickets.status`
- `customer_tickets.priority`
- `customer_tickets.created_at`
- `sales_data.transaction_date`
- `sales_data.region`

Use these fields in your `WHERE` clauses for better performance.

---

### 6. **Limit Large Result Sets**

Always use `LIMIT` when fetching data for processing:

```sql
SELECT * FROM customer_tickets
WHERE status = 'open'
ORDER BY created_at ASC
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### 7. **Use Transactions for Multiple Operations**

For workflows that update multiple tables, use the "Execute Query" mode with transaction support.
