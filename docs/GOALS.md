## üéØ Workshop Mission

Demonstrate how open-source AI tools can provide **cost-effective, private, and scalable** alternatives to cloud-based AI services for building intelligent automation workflows.

### Core Value Proposition

**"Your AI, Your Schedule, Your Data"**

- **Time Optimization**: Instead of spending valuable daytime hours on data processing, schedule AI agents to work overnight‚Äîwake up to completed analysis, processed tickets, and generated reports
- **Cost Efficiency**: Processing that costs $50-500/month in cloud APIs costs only electricity (~$5-15/month) when running locally
- **Data Privacy**: Your sensitive business data never leaves your infrastructure  
- **No Usage Limits**: Experiment, iterate, and scale without per-token charges
- **Learning Freedom**: Full visibility into how everything works‚Äîno black boxes

By the end of this workshop, attendees will:

1. **Understand the open-source AI stack** (n8n + Ollama + OpenWebUI)
2. **Have a working local setup** on their Windows or macOS machine
3. **Build their first AI agent** that integrates with real business systems
4. **Evaluate cost/benefit** of local vs. cloud AI solutions
5. **Identify use cases** applicable to their organization
