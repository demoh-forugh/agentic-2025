## Step## 10) Install n8nDocker Desktop

### Download and Install

1. Visit [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
2. Download the installer
{{ ... }}
.\scripts\verify-windows.ps1
```

---

## 2) Install n8n in Complete!

You now have a complete local AI agent stack running!

### Next Steps

2. **[Sample Workflows](../workflows/)** - Import pre-built workflows into n8n
3. **Test Your Setup** - Try the hello-world workflow

---

## üîß Optional: Install n8n CLI Tools

For advanced users who want to manage workflows via CLI:

```powershell
# Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/
# Then install n8n globally
npm install -g n8n
```

## üçé macOS Installation

This section covers installing and running the workshop stack on macOS using Docker Desktop for Mac and the provided helper scripts.

### Prerequisites (macOS)

- **OS**: macOS 12+ (Monterey) recommended
- **Docker**: Docker Desktop for Mac installed and running
- **Command line tools**: `bash`, `curl`
- **Optional**: `jq` for JSON parsing (install via Homebrew: `brew install jq`)

### Quick Start (Scripts)

```bash
# From the repository root

# 1) Make scripts executable (first time only)
chmod +x ./scripts/setup-mac.sh \
         ./scripts/verify-mac.sh \
         ./scripts/measure-cold-warm.sh

# 2) Setup: start Docker services and prepare environment
./scripts/setup-mac.sh

# 3) Verify: check services are reachable
./scripts/verify-mac.sh

# 4) Measure: collect cold vs warm performance
#    JSON will be saved under artifacts/performance/
./scripts/measure-cold-warm-mac.sh

# Optional environment overrides:
MODEL="llama3.2:3b" WARM_RUNS=5 ./scripts/measure-cold-warm-mac.sh
```

### Manual Setup (Alternative on macOS)

```bash
# 1) Copy configuration into repo root (if not already present)
cp configs/docker-compose.yml ./docker-compose.yml
cp configs/.env.example ./.env

# 2) Start services
docker compose up -d    # or: docker-compose up -d

# 3) Pull a model inside the Ollama container (optional)
docker exec -it ollama ollama pull llama3.2

# 4) Verify
curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags       # Ollama API
curl http://localhost:5678/healthz         # n8n
open http://localhost:3000/                # OpenWebUI (opens default browser)
```

### Access URLs (same as Windows)

- **OpenWebUI**: http://localhost:3000
- **n8n**: http://localhost:5678
- **Ollama API**: http://localhost:11434

## üìä Resource Usage

### Expected Resource Consumption

- **Ollama (with llama3.2 4GB model)**: ~4-6GB RAM
- **Ollama (with llama3.2:1b 1GB model)**: ~1-2GB RAM
- **OpenWebUI**: ~200-300MB RAM
- **n8n**: ~300-500MB RAM
- **Docker overhead**: ~500MB RAM

**Total Expected**: 
- With 4GB model: ~5-7GB RAM in active use
- With 1GB model: ~2-4GB RAM in active use

**To measure on your own system:**
```powershell
# Start containers
docker-compose up -d

# Monitor resources while running inference
docker stats --no-stream
nvidia-smi
```

**Placeholder for actual data:**
- **Ollama (idle)**: [MEASURE NEEDED]
- **Ollama (active inference with GPU)**: [MEASURE NEEDED]
- **Ollama (active inference CPU-only)**: [MEASURE NEEDED]
- **OpenWebUI**: [MEASURE NEEDED]
- **n8n**: [MEASURE NEEDED]
- **Docker Desktop overhead**: [MEASURE NEEDED]
- **GPU usage during inference**: [MEASURE NEEDED]
- **CPU usage during inference**: [MEASURE NEEDED]

## üõü Troubleshooting

### Docker Desktop won't start
- Ensure WSL2 is installed and updated
- Check if virtualization is enabled in BIOS
- Restart Docker Desktop service

### Docker shows "500 Internal Server Error"
This error typically means Docker Desktop is installed but not fully running or not logged in:

1. **Open Docker Desktop** from the Windows Start Menu
2. **Log in or skip login** when prompted (Docker Desktop requires this step)
3. **Wait for initialization** (30-60 seconds)
4. **Verify status**: Look for the Docker whale icon in system tray showing "Engine running"
5. **Run the setup script again** after Docker Desktop is fully started

### First-time setup appears to stall during "Pulling"
This is **normal behavior**! Docker performs two phases:

1. **Download phase**: Downloads ~4-5 GB of Docker images (5-15 minutes)
2. **Verification/Extraction phase**: After download completes, Docker verifies and extracts images (1-3 minutes)
   - Status will still show "Pulling" during verification
   - Progress bars may appear complete but verification continues
   - **Be patient** - this is a necessary security step

### Containers won't start
```powershell
# Check logs
docker-compose logs

# Restart services
docker-compose restart
```

### Port conflicts
If ports 3000, 5678, or 11434 are already in use:
1. Edit `docker-compose.yml`
2. Change port mappings (e.g., `3000:3000` ‚Üí `3001:3000`)
3. Restart: `docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d`

### Models won't download
- Check internet connection
- Ensure Docker has network access
- Try a smaller model first
